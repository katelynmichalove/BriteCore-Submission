# Take-home Submission

## Assumptions

- BriteCore is a web-based software therefore the high fidelity mockup should be a desktop view. 
- The questions listed collect all of the data needed for the algorithm to give an accurate estimate for the client. 
- This design is for a specific widget and therefore won’t include the entire browser design. 
- This form will be used by the client to assist a customer. Therefore the language used must match the type of language the client will want to use when addressing the customer. The questions should be quickly identifiable for an ease of conversation. 
- This widget will be used in a professional environment which means the visual design should be trustworthy, clean, and professional. 
- User Story:  As an agent using BriteCore, I am able to quickly get a replacement cost estimate for my customer, so that they can have the correct amount of homeowner's insurance.

## Questions

- Can the current text content be improved? 
- Is it time consuming to click each quality option for more details? The agent may have to click 5 times in order to get a description of each quality for the customer?
- Should the images be shown alongside the options for house quality? Should there be an image for each option? Will the agent’s customer be able to see these images? How can the agent best help their user to select a quality?
- Are the house descriptions helpful? Would the agent use these descriptions when talking with a client? If not, are there other descriptions that may be helpful? 
- How is the agent interacting with the customer? Over the phone? Or is this information the agent has already collected and now they are filling it out independently?
- Is the quality of the home referring to the exterior only or is it referring to the general quality of the home interior and exterior? 
- Should it be customer initiated or should it automatically calculate when the answers are put in? 
- Does the agent have an image of the customer’s house when choosing the quality or is it a verbal selection when talking with the customer?
- Does the square footage include deck areas?

## Research

I analyzed Esurance and Progressive to determine the information they collect, how they collect it, strengths, and weaknesses. I also looked at how it would differ from an agent user to a direct customer user.

### *Esurance Competitive Analysis*

- First they collect the user’s personal information which helps them search for data to prefill some of the house information on the form, which saves the user time. 
- In this case the user is filling it out without the agent therefore the considerations will be different for the language and layout. 
- Layout consists of the questions on the left and the answer options on the right. 
- Headline titles are above questions that relate to one another. 
- There is an image for each quality choice and a description that relates to that quality. The ordering of the quality choices could be confusing since they are not increasing in quality as you read down the list. The words chosen make sense and allow me to quickly identify from the list. I will utilize this language in the design of the quality question. 


### *Progressive Competitive Analysis*

- Orders by structure, exterior, interior, utilities. 
- Very clean, simple, professional design. 
- Great imagery for selecting from the choices in material and shape. 
- The visual design on the selection boxes seem disabled where the user may think they aren’t able to select. 
- Strong design and layout. Similar to Esurance with the questions on the left and answer choices on the right. Answer options differ greatly depending on the questions. Tend to present many images to choose from which users tend to prefer. 

**Notes:** The imagery presented is very helpful for users but may not be as needed if an agent is talking with a customer on the phone. Language in this case is much more helpful. 

## The Client's User- Interview

When talking with homeowners I learned how they think of the quality of their home. Economy and standard were not words that they commonly associated with the quality of a home. They used words such as ‘builder grade’ when talking about a lower quality home, and talked about luxury with high quality. They discussed the finishes such as crown molding, counter tops, flooring, new appliances, wood finishes such as beams, high quality insulation, decks, views, etc. 

Since this is the only question that requires more in depth discussion, I spent the most time on improving the usability and conversation that the agent would be having. I wanted to make sure they could accurately collect the right quality level from their customer. 
## Content Strategy
